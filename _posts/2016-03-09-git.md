## Using Git and Github

### 1. Create an account.

### 2. Create new repository.

Click on the plus dropdown button on the top right hand. Click on new repository.

Name your repository and check the box to create a README.md.

### 3. Click on edit file or add new file

This way you don't have to save anything local on your computer! You can directly write your code into the files on Github.

## Github Perks?

### 1. Share code with others easily.

Whatever you put on your Github repos are open-sourced - open for everyone to copy and modify (unless you make your repo "private").

### 2. Update your code with new changes.

### 3. You can see your updates with "commits" and your "commit messages".

Commits are basically updating your Github log with *any* kind of changes you have made since the last time you committed your code. 
By committing your newly changed code, you can see what you have changed since the last commit.
